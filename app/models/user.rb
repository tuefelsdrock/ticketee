  # By not calling any methods on the user object and attempting to write it out of the
  # view, you cause Ruby to call to_s on this method. By default, this outputs something
  # similar to the following, which isnâ€™t human friendly: <User:0xb6fd6054>
  #
  # override the to_s method on the model to provide the string containing
  # the email and admin status of the user: 
  #
  def to_s
    "#{email} (#{admin? ? "Admin" : "User"})"
