Ticketee: 
The Australian slang for a person who checks tickets on trains. 

This project is a ticket-tracking application, and a Rails application, at that.

Design Goals:
* Track tickets and group them into projects
* Provide a way to restrict users to certain projects
* Allow users to upload files to tickets
* Let users tag tickets so they are easy to find
* Provide an API on which users can base development of their own applications
